# Inference Engine

A custom high-performance C++ inference engine for transformer-based language models. This engine is designed to run a 30 million parameter model trained on the TinyStories dataset.

## Quick Start (macOS)

This project is specifically developed for macOS. To build and run:

```bash

# Step 0: Install OpenMP dependency
brew install libomp

# Step 1: Build the project
make

# Step 2: Run inference
./a.out
```

## Platform Compatibility

This project is optimized exclusively for **macOS (Apple Silicon)**, utilizing the **ARM NEON** library for SIMD instructions.

## Overview

This project implements a complete inference pipeline for decoder-only transformer models. The engine features optimized matrix multiplication with SIMD instructions, a GPT-2 compatible Byte Pair Encoding tokenizer, and a modular architecture that separates tensor operations, model components, and tokenization.

## Performance Comparison

The engine was benchmarked against naive PyTorch implementations running on both Apple Silicon (MPS) and CPU. All results reported below are the **mean of 5 independent runs** using the provided `benchmark.sh` script.

| Metric | PyTorch (MPS) | PyTorch (CPU) | Custom C++ Engine | Speedup (vs MPS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TTFT** | 910.29 ms | 13.53 ms | 14.08 ms | $\approx 64.6\text{x}$ |
| **Avg Time / Token** | 87.00 ms | 12.20 ms | 8.11 ms | $\approx 10.7\text{x}$ |
| **Throughput** | 11.49 tok/s | 81.96 tok/s | 120.94 tok/s | $\approx 10.5\text{x}$ |

A `benchmark.sh` script is provided in the root directory to reproduce these metrics and perform comparative analysis.

## Optimizations

The engine achieves its performance through several low-level optimization techniques:

### 1. SIMD Kernels (NEON/AVX)
Utilizes hardware-level vectorization to process multiple data points in a single instruction.
- **Implemented in**: `operator+`, `operator*`, `LayerNorm`, `operator/`, `softmax`, `add_bias`.

### 2. Tiled Matrix Multiplication
Implements a cache-efficient 32x32 tiling strategy to minimize cache misses and maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
- **Implemented in**: `operator*`.

### 3. OpenMP Parallelism
Distributes independent compute-heavy loops across multiple CPU cores, using adaptive thresholds to avoid threading overhead on small tensors.
- **Implemented in**: `operator*` (matmul), `operator+` (addition), `softmax`, `add_bias`, `gelu`, and `multiheadattention`.

### 4. KV Caching
Implements Key-Value caching for $O(N)$ incremental decoding, preventing the redundant re-computation of previous tokens during the generation phase.
- **Implemented in**: `attention` (using `KVCache` structure).

## Model Architecture

The engine supports a decoder-only transformer with the following configuration:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Parameters | ~30M |
| d_model | 256 |
| Number of Heads | 8 |
| Number of Blocks | 6 |
| d_k (per head) | 32 |
| Vocabulary Size | 50257 |
| Max Sequence Length | 128 |
| Training Dataset | TinyStories |

## Building

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (g++ or clang++)
- Python 3.x with transformers library (for tokenizer export)

### Compile

```bash
make
```

The Makefile uses the following optimization flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| -std=c++17 | C++17 standard |
| -O3 | Maximum optimization level |
| -march=native | Enable CPU-specific SIMD instructions |
| -ffast-math | Aggressive floating-point optimizations |
| -funroll-loops | Loop unrolling for performance |

### Export Tokenizer

Before running inference, export the GPT-2 tokenizer vocabulary:

```bash
python tokenizer.py
```

This creates `gpt2_vocab.json` and `merges.txt` in the project root.

## Usage

### Running Inference

```bash
./a.out
```

The Runner class initializes the model with weights from the `weights/` directory and performs autoregressive generation.

### Customizing Generation

Edit the `run()` function in `runner.hpp` to modify:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| prompt | "Hello, how are you?" | Input text for generation |
| max_new_tokens | 5 | Maximum tokens to generate |
| temperature | 0.8 | Sampling temperature (0 = greedy) |
| seq_len | 128 | Maximum context length |

### Example Output

```

## Tensor Operations

The Tensor class implements the following operations:

| Operation | Method | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Matrix Multiplication | operator* | Tiled matmul with 32x32 blocks |
| Addition | operator+ | Element-wise addition |
| Division | operator/ | Scalar division |
| Transpose | t() | Matrix transpose |
| Softmax | softmax() | Row-wise softmax with numerical stability |
| Layer Normalization | LayerNorm() | Normalization with learnable parameters |
| Causal Mask | mask() | Lower triangular mask for attention |
| Concatenation | concat_horizontal() | Horizontal tensor concatenation |
| Concatenation | concat_vertical() | Vertical tensor concatenation (used for KV cache) |
| Bias Addition | add_bias() | Add bias vector to each row |

## Weight Format

Weights are stored in NumPy `.npy` format and loaded at runtime. The naming convention follows:

```
transforms.{block}.{component}.{head}.{weight|bias}.npy
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| q | Query projection |
| k | Key projection |
| v | Value projection |
| join | Output projection (after attention) |
| ffn.0 | FFN intermediate layer |
| ffn.3 | FFN output layer |
| norm1 | Pre-attention layer norm |
| norm2 | Pre-FFN layer norm |

## Performance Considerations

| Optimization | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Tiled matrix multiplication | Reduces cache misses |
| SIMD via -march=native | 2-4x speedup on modern CPUs |
| -ffast-math | Enables vectorization of floating-point ops |
| -funroll-loops | Reduces loop overhead |
| Const references | Avoids unnecessary copies |
| Reserve for vectors | Prevents reallocations |

## Error Handling

The engine includes comprehensive error handling:

- Shape mismatch detection for all tensor operations
- Try-catch blocks around attention and forward passes
- Validation of weight dimensions during initialization
- Graceful handling of missing tokenizer files
- Detailed error messages with tensor shapes

## Limitations

| Limitation | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Single GPU | CPU-only implementation |
| Batch Size | Supports batch size of 1 |
| Precision | FP32 only (no FP16/INT8 quantization) |
| Context | Fixed maximum context length |
